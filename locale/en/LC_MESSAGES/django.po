"I am a developer. Development is a hobby and a means of livelihood for me. I "
"enjoy the joy of seeing the result of the coding. And I like to talk to "
"developers about development. So I'm thinking of making a conversation with "
"developers in the near future. And I am very interested in teaching "
"programming to non-developers these days. I think that programming is going "
"to become more and more common in the world. "
